I was in charge of making all the important architectural and design decisions. This experience gave me confidence and decision making skills. I've also greatly improved my communication skills, since I often had to propose new ideas, discuss possible implementations and even argue with the project manager when I thought some decisions were wrong.\n\nThanks to this experience, I'm now able to create by myself a medium-sized React application. I can handle most parts of a fullstack project including the UI design, database structure, the actual coding in typescript, the deployment in Firebase, the security, accessibility and many more.",
